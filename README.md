# Gaming Room Use it or Lose it
The client is the Gaming Room and they wanted to move their game “Draw it or Lose it” a guessing game from Android to a larger platform. They had started out small and had little technological experience but over time had grown and their needs were more extensive. It started as a game app that eventually moved towards something that needed larger Operating platforms.  

I really liked how well I researched which platform that they should use, in the end I recommended LInux as it was open source and the best platform that would be secure and offer the needs the client asked for.  

With a design document it was easier and more helpful to know where to begin, what to work on and to keep track of everything I was working on. As well as order of importance regarding the needs of the client.  

I would improve the zip file and really take my time with it and absorb it more. I would also be able to understand what it was I was working on better if I could take my time and go over the code with a fresh set of eyes.  

I took literally everything that the user would need as I researched and designed the backdrop for their game as well as platform. It’s essential to consider the user because they will be the one that is directly impacted by anything that is designed and created for them. It is essential to have their needs in the forefront of the mind when creating a software design. 

I would keep the needs of the client and the user in the front of my mind and after I went over what it was that they wanted then I would proceed to design and analyze the software application. Especially after understanding each of the different platforms. In the end it isn’t about what I would personally want, it is about the ease and needs of the user and to keep that in mind and not just go off what is popular or in demand.
